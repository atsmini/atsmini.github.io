				<p>Hi!   The name of our team is AMNVOLT, and we promise that we will continue to use the best materials to make this mini radio, and continue to improve its hardware.</p>
<p>We are also very, very grateful to @OM0ET and Dave for their great and outstanding contributions to this radio!   Their continued selfless dedication has led to a lot of hardware and software improvements for this radio.</p>
<p>Due to the presence of low-quality products from substandard manufacturers on the market—which may use inferior screens, main control chips, or even poor-quality batteries—users may experience degraded performance, and the hardware may not support the latest firmware updates.</p>
<p>We have listed on this website the stores that sell high-quality products manufactured by us.   Feel free to choose and purchase from them:</p>

<!-- <p>2. Most of the stores currently selling V3 in the market have already replaced their goods with V3S for sale since June. However, they are still using the pictures of V3 and haven't had the chance to make the replacement yet. If you are not sure whether the radio sold in the store you purchased is a V3S, you can contact us to confirm. As long as the front of the radio is printed with the words "AMNVOLT", it is very likely to be a V3S.</p> -->

<p><span><b>How to distinguish radio versions when purchasing : </b></span></p>
<p>1. Check the exterior design as shown in the images. (Note: Some V2 radios retained the V1 design during production - contact the seller's customer service for confirmation)</p>
<p>2. Verify both front and back panels: Radios printed with our brand "AMNVOLT" are 100% genuine V3 models (with built-in headphone amplifier and Hi-Z)</p>
<p>3. Review product listing comments to see images shared by other buyers.</p>

            <p>1. Double-click the button on the home screen to enter the menu</p>
            <p>2. On the menu page, rotate the knob to switch the menu and mode, etc. Click again to "Confirm".</p>
            <p>3. On the home screen, rotate the knob to change the frequency band, and click again to confirm.</p>
            <p>4. Because the case is very small,so the volume output is low after the earphone is inserted, which is a normal phenomenon, and the external audio can be connected to reach a larger volume.</p>
